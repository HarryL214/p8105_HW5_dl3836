# p8105 HW5 (dl3836)

This repository contains the materials for P8105 Homework 5.

## Repository structure

- `p8105_hw5_dl3836.Rmd`: Primary R Markdown file containing the solutions for
  Problems 1–3. The document is configured to knit to `github_document`.
- `data/`: Directory for datasets used in the assignment. The `homicide-data.csv`
  file required for Problem 3 will be downloaded automatically into this folder
  if it is not already present when the R Markdown document is knitted.

To reproduce the analysis, open the R Project (or the repository) in RStudio and
knit `p8105_hw5_dl3836.Rmd`. The document loads only the packages needed for the
analysis and relies on relative file paths throughout.
